# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves setting up and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for the Backlogger project to enhance development capabilities. The MCP configuration should provide seamless integration with the existing Next.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL stack while enabling powerful development tools and workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure MCP servers that complement my tech stack, so that I can access enhanced development tools and capabilities directly within my IDE.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL include servers that support PostgreSQL database operations
2. WHEN the MCP configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL include servers that support filesystem operations within the project
3. WHEN the MCP configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL include servers that support web search capabilities for development research
4. WHEN the MCP configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL include a GitHub MCP server configuration
5. WHEN MCP servers are configured THEN they SHALL use dotenvx and local environment files for sensitive configuration data
6. WHEN MCP servers are configured THEN they SHALL prioritize Nix and npm package sources over other package managers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want MCP servers to automatically connect to my existing database setup, so that I can perform database operations without manual connection management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PostgreSQL MCP server is configured THEN it SHALL use the existing DATABASE_URL environment variable through dotenvx
2. WHEN the PostgreSQL MCP server is configured THEN it SHALL support read operations like querying tables and describing schema
3. WHEN the PostgreSQL MCP server is configured THEN it SHALL work with any PostgreSQL hosting service
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL complement rather than replace Prisma ORM functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want MCP servers to have appropriate security and auto-approval settings, so that I can work efficiently while maintaining security boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP servers are configured THEN safe read operations SHALL be auto-approved
2. WHEN MCP servers are configured THEN write operations SHALL require explicit approval
3. WHEN environment variables contain sensitive data THEN they SHALL be referenced rather than hardcoded in the configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP configuration to be maintainable and well-documented, so that team members can understand and modify the setup as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP configuration is created THEN it SHALL include clear comments explaining each server's purpose
2. WHEN the MCP configuration is created THEN it SHALL follow JSON formatting standards
3. WHEN the MCP configuration is created THEN it SHALL be organized logically with essential servers listed first
4. WHEN the MCP configuration is created THEN it SHALL include instructions for adding credentials where needed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using Nix and npm, I want MCP servers to integrate with my preferred package management tools, so that I can maintain consistency with my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP servers require package installation THEN they SHALL prioritize Nix packages when available
2. WHEN MCP servers require Node.js packages THEN they SHALL use npm over other package managers
3. WHEN MCP servers are configured THEN they SHALL leverage existing dotenvx setup for environment variable management
4. WHEN GitHub integration is configured THEN it SHALL be enabled by default with proper environment variable configuration
