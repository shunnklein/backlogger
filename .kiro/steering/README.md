## About Kiro Steering

Steering files allow you to include additional context and instructions that guide Kiro's responses. They can be:

- Always included (default behavior)
- Conditionally included when specific files are read
- Manually included via context keys in chat

For more information about Kiro and steering configuration, see the [Kiro Documentation](https://kiro.dev/docs/).
